The provided code is a JavaScript program that fetches and displays a list of movies from "The Movie Database" (TMDb) based on user interactions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code starts by defining three constant variables:
   - `API_URL`: This variable stores the URL for fetching a list of movies ordered by popularity from the TMDb API. It includes an API key and a page parameter, set to page 1.
   - `IMG_PATH`: This variable stores the base URL for movie poster images on TMDb.
   - `SEARCH_API`: This variable stores the URL for searching movies by a user-provided query. It also includes the API key.

2. The code then retrieves references to HTML elements using `document.getElementById`:
   - `main`: A reference to an HTML element with the ID 'main', where movie cards will be displayed.
   - `form`: A reference to an HTML form element.
   - `search`: A reference to an HTML input element inside the form.

3. The `getMovies` function is defined, which is responsible for fetching movie data from the TMDb API and calling the `showMovies` function to display the movies. It accepts a URL parameter for API requests and is marked as `async/await` to handle asynchronous data fetching.

4. The `showMovies` function is defined to display the movies on the web page. It takes an array of movie objects as a parameter and creates a set of movie cards for each movie. Each card displays the movie title, poster image, rating, and overview.

5. Inside the `showMovies` function, a `forEach` loop iterates over the movie objects, and for each movie, it creates a new HTML element to represent the movie card.

6. The `getClassByRate` function is defined to determine the CSS class for rating styling. It takes a movie's vote average as a parameter and returns 'green', 'orange', or 'red' based on the vote average value. This is used to style the rating text on the movie card.

7. An event listener is attached to the form element for the 'submit' event. When the form is submitted, the following actions occur:
   - Prevent the default form submission behavior (`e.preventDefault()`).
   - Retrieve the value of the user's search query from the input element with the ID 'search'.
   - If a search query is provided and not empty:
     - Call the `getMovies` function with the `SEARCH_API` and the user's search query.
     - Clear the input field by setting its value to an empty string.
   - If no search query is provided, refresh the page to display the default list of popular movies.

The code combines HTML, JavaScript, and the TMDb API to create a simple movie search and display application. Users can search for movies by title, and the application will fetch and display the search results dynamically.
